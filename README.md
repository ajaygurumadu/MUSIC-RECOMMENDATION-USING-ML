A machine learning initiative called the Music Genre Recommendation System aims to offer customized music recommendations depending on user input. In order to anticipate users' favorite music genres, the system makes use of a neural network model that was trained on survey data and incorporates variables like age, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. By providing personalized music recommendations based on users' tastes and moods, the project seeks to improve user experience.
